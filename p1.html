 <h3>introduction </h3>
 <p style="font-size:30px;" >
  
Computer technology has made incredible progress in the roughly 65 years since
the first general-purpose electronic computer was created. Today, less than $500
will purchase a mobile computer that has more performance, more main memory,
and more disk storage than a computer bought in 1985 for $1 million. This rapid
improvement has come both from advances in the technology used to build computers and from innovations in computer design.
