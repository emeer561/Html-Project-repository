<h3>Historical Perspectives and References</h3>
<p>Appendix L (available online) includes historical perspectives on the key ideas
presented in each of the chapters in this text. These historical perspective sections
allow us to trace the development of an idea through a series of machines or
describe significant projects. If you’re interested in examining the initial development of an idea or machine or interested in further reading, 
references are provided at the end of each history. For this chapter, see Section L.2, The Early
Development of Computers, for a discussion on the early development of digital
computers and performance measurement methodologies. 
As you read the historical material, you’ll soon come to realize that one of the
important benefits of the youth of computing, compared to many other engineering fields, is that many of the pioneers are still alive—we can learn the history by
simply asking them</p>
